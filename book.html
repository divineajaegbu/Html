     <p><b class="big">N</b>othing is more vital to the Christian life than to walk<br>
        daily after the spirit. It is this that maintains the Christian <br>
        of the flesh, assists him to obey God'swill always, and shields him<br>
        from the assault of satan. Now that we understand the operaations of our spirit,<br>
        we must immediately walk by it. This is a moment by moments affair from which there<br>
        can be no relaxing. In these days we must be keenly alert to the peril of receiving the teaching<br>
        of the Holy spirit while subsequently rejecting His leading. On this very point have many saints stumbled<br>
        and fallen. To acquire teaching alone is not sufficient, we must also accept the leading. We should <br>
        not be content with just spiritual knowledge but treasure as well the walk after the spirit.Often we hear<br>
        people drop the words, <q>the way of the cross;</q> but what is this way after all? it is an reality<br>
        nothing else but walking by the spirit, since to walk in that fashion necessitates the commiting of our<br>
        ideas, wishes and thoughts to death. Exclusively following the spirit'sintuition and revelation demands<br>
        our bearing the cross daily.</p>
